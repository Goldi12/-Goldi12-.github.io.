    <h1><strong><em>8 Websites With Really <br> Awesome User Interface <br>(UI) Design</em></strong></h1><br>

    <h4>Length: 15 Minutes</h4>
    <p>We’ve all encountered websites and applications that <br>make us want to throw our devices across the room in <br> frustration. At least, I hope it’s not just me. Fundamentally,<br> a good user interface enables users to complete the task
      <br>that they came to the website to do with ease and without <br>confusion.</p><br>

    <p>Truly <a href="https://www.macfound.org/fellows/class-of-2005/jon-kleinberg"> great UI designers achieve this and more.</a> Really <br> exceptional user interfaces will not just please the user by <br>facilitating the frictionless achievement
      of the task at hand <br>—they will also please them aesthetically and <br> experientially.<br>

      And that could mean any number of things: a slick,<br> original animated interaction that intuitively draws the <br> user’s attention to a certain element, or an uncluttered,<br> clean design and clever use of white space that imbues <br>the
      user with a sense of calm, for example.<br>

      In this article, I’ll tackle the question of what makes a good <br>user interface—with a bit of help from the Nielsen Norman <br>
      Group—before diving into eight examples of <a href="https://codepen.io/pen/">great UI <br>design, </a> and a substantiation of my choice. Select an <br> example below to jump straight to it, or read on and let me <br> know whether you agree—or
      not—in the comments.</p> <br>

      <p>So, if you’re wondering how to evaluate whether a user <br>interface is good—or even great—how do you decide? <br> I mean, you can determine whether you find a user <br>interface visually appealing, and you can of course use the <br>interface to ascertain whether it’s an intuitive,<br> straightforward experience. But is there anything more <br>objective? More formalized?</p><br>
      <h1><strong>How do you know if the UI design of a website is good?</strong></h1><br>

      <p>Personally, I always refer back to <a href="https://careerfoundry.com/en/blog/ui-design/8-sites-with-great-ui/">the usability <br>characteristics defined by the research company Nielsen <br> Norman Group.</a></p><br>

      <p>Nielsen defines Usability through the following five <br>characteristics; learnability, efficiency, memorability, errors <br>and satisfaction.</p><br>

      <ul>
        <li<a><strong>Learnability:</strong></a>Can the user complete their tasks with <br>little difficulty?</li><br>
        <li<a><strong>Efficiency:</strong></a>Does the interface allow the user to <br>complete tasks in a timely manner?</li><br>
        <li<a><strong>Memorability: </strong></a>After leaving a website, how likely will <br> the user be able to remember how to use it the next <br>time they visit?</li><br>
        <li<a><strong>Errors: </strong></a>What steps does the interface take to lessen <br> the chance of user error, and how do they let the users <br>correct an error?</li><br>
        <li<a><strong>Satisfaction: </strong></a>Does the user enjoy interacting with the <br>design?</li><br>

      </ul>
      <p>And on top of those standards, a great UI should also <br>
         reflect the personality of the brand in order to stand out <br> from the competition and provide users with a delightful <br> experience. <br>So let’s check out a few examples of where I <br>think companies have gotten their UI spot on.</p><br>
      <h1><strong><em>Medium</em></strong></h1><br>
      <img src="hey.jpg" alt="image">
      <p>Medium, an online reading and publishing platform, is just <br> as gorgeous as it is functional. With minimal use of stro
        <strong>color,</strong> <br>generous line spacing, and a well chosen combination of <br> <strong> typography,</strong> this website gets everything right.<br><br>

With Medium, content is king. Once a user is logged in, a <br> box appears at the top of the article list with the text “Write <br> here”, enabling and encouraging everyone to get writing <br>quickly. When users click on the “Write a Story” link, they <br> are presented with an almost empty white page, removing <br>clutter and simply providing a clean space to focus on <br> writing.<br><br>

Articles are set up in a one column format, making <br> content easy to digest. With little touches like estimated <br>ead time and the ability to highlight and respond directly <br> to specific pieces of articles, Medium truly provides users <br> with an amazing and effortless editorial experience.</p><br>
<h1><strong><em>Virgin America</em></strong></h1><br>
<p>Bear with me on this one. Just for a moment.<br><br>

When it comes to helping users complete the process of <br> booking a flight, Virgin America was one of the first – if not <br> the first – to put the user’s interests front and centre. For <br> most, booking a flight is a chore. Much like a dishwasher <br> relieves us of having to scrub the dishes, Virgin America’s <br> site stripped back their interface to draw attention to the <br>most important question: “Where would you like to go?” <br>

 the surrounding content, the user could <br> immediately start the booking process.<br>

And yes, the site might now look a little dated, but it <br> deserves its place on this list as something of a trailblazer <br>in user-centered interface design. Unfortunately, since <br> merging with Alaska Air, their approach to UI has become <br> decidedly more cluttered.</p>
<img src="pro.jpg" alt="image">
<p>Back to what made Virgin America’s site great though:<br> Throughout the entire process of booking, the user was <br>eminded of their selection by a bar at the top of the <br>screen showing their current choices. <br>By keeping this information visible, Virgin made it easy for users to <br>constantly see and edit their choices instead of relying on <br> them to recall the information themselves. The UI here <br>was clearly designed to ensure that a user can focus on <br>completing their goal as quickly and efficiently as possible.</p>
